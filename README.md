## Context:
### This project was given to simulate a take home challenge one may be given in a job interview. 
- No more than 8 hours total was to be spent on the challenge
- I was required to use the api https://newsapi.org/
- It was required to have a list view of articles for the user, ability to click on any of the articles in the list to view more detail about the article, and to have some sort of search/filter functionality for the articles.
- 
## Goals:
- Build a react application with multiple pages that allows users to manipulate data in some way (search and filter)
### Wins:
- Completing the MVP in the 8 hour time limit, including Cypress testing
- Implementing React and Router
- Using a public API
